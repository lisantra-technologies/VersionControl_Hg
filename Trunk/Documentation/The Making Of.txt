THE MAKING OF THE PEAR PACKAGE VERSIONCONTROL_HG
================================================




Design Decisions
================


Architecture
------------

* No method in the API should have more than argument (arrays are OK a a convenience)
* No mixed case, since its hard to type capitals quickly (interrupts my flow)

Exceptions
----------
All Exception inherit directly from PHP's base Exception class.

At first, I created a heirarchy of exceptions. For example,
VersionControl_Hg_Command_Exception extended VersionControl_Hg_Exception.
However, this started to get funky once I started using error constants defined
in the exception classes and then further wanted to (re)implement dynamic
messages (because overridden __construct methods should call parent::__construct)
which I felt really ought to be Exception itself and not VersionControl_Hg_Exception.
Plus, I started to get some errors, and wanted to be sure my no-value-added
nesting wasn't complicating the situation (it probably was complicating it, even
if it did not cause the errors).
