CHANGELOG

0.4.0
    * Implemented 'pull' command.
    * Finally got the 'version' command to work and populate the version
      property of the Executable class.

0.5.0
    * 'Cat' recieved the files() option function. Also, Cat will now only accept
      multiple files using files() rather than array in the command function,
      which will still optionally accept a single file. Calling files() after
      specifying a single file in cat('/a/file') will overwrite that in cat()?

    * Option functions which select sets of files now take additional schemes
      and syntaxes. Previously VersionControl_Hg only supported the glob scheme,
      and even then only as a single argument to the option function:
      `...excluding("**.php")`. This older, but simple to use syntax is still
      supported as the default, mostly because I think its the most useful.

      Additional schemes and their syntax variants are as follows:

        * re: a PERL/Python regular expression.

          ex. `...excluding("re:.*\.php$")`
          ex. `...excluding(array('re' => '.*\.php$'))`

        * set: a fileset DSL (Only in Mercurial 1.9 and later; VersionControl_Hg
          will automatically check for its presence and raise an exception
          if your version is less than 1.9 and try to use this scheme).

          ex. `...excluding("set: ")`
          ex. `...excluding(array('set' => ''))`

        * path: a full path, from the repository root including the file name.

          ex. `...excluding("path:hg_root/mydir/myfile.php")`
          ex. `...excluding(array('path' => 'hg_root/mydir/myfile.php'))`

        * listfile: a file of full path/file names, one per line.

          ex. `...excluding("listfile:list_of_files.txthg_root/mydir/myfile.php")`
          ex. `...excluding(array('listfile' => 'list_of_files.txt'))`

        A dynamic list of specifically named files which may not consider the
        above schemes as useful, may be selected with VersionControl_Hg's
        `files(array('file1','file2'))` method.

        Option functions which support file selection schemes are:
          * excluding()
          * including()
          * files()
